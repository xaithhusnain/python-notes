print("hello world")

#  CONCEPTS OF STRINGS

# we can use single double and triples quotes to represent data in str

a = 'he is a coder.'
a = "he is a coder."
a = '''he is a coder.'''


# why we need triple and double qoutes as we can use it single to represent str

# we use double when we use apostrophe in our str

# d = 'he a coder and learning 'python''

d = "he a coder and learning 'python'"
