# Python Notes by Ali Husnain

Welcome to my **personal Python notes repository**!  
I have written these notes myself while learning and practicing Python in VS Code.  
My goal is to share them with others so you can learn Python step by step just like I did.  
These notes are **well-structured, practical, and beginner-friendly**.

## How to Use These Notes
1. Browse the folders to explore Python concepts.

## Why I Created This
I am very passionate about learning and teaching Python.  
These notes are my personal learning journey — but I am sharing them so **others can learn Python easily too**.
